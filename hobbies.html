                <p>My favorite summer time hobby is shore fishing, particularly in the Santa Barbara area.</p>

            <li><h4>Method: </h4><p>Bottom rig baited with <b>squid</b> and 2oz weight</p></li>
            <li><h4>Description: </h4><p>The largest fish I had ever caught up to this point. While reeling in my line to recast, I felt an odd surplus of weight. Initially I thought nothing of it other than more seaweed to take off, but I began to feel the 'seaweed' fight back. After the help of another fisherman I was able to get this photo to cap off the beautiful sunset.</p></li>

            <li><h4>Method: </h4><p>Curl tail grub with 1/4oz jig head. Casting along the base of the pier with a slow constant retrieve</p></li>
            <li><h4>Description: </h4><p>My personal favorite. As you will see throughout this gallery my main method is using <b>squid</b>. In doing so, it is difficult to target a specific species. This summer I set out on a mission to not only catch something with an artifical lure, but to catch a halibut! This lure in particular had major success and I wound up catching 8 in total!</p></li>

            <li><h4>Description: </h4><p>My faith in fishing restored! After days of trying I was unable to catch anything but tiny bait fish. I decided it was time to try a new spot, which I soon became a regular at. While retrieving my bait for another cast, I noticed a dark shadow dart out from the reef towards the squid. Once the fight was over I snapped this photo and tossed him back in.</p></li>

            <li><h4>Method: </h4><p>Hook with <b>squid</b> and no weight. Aimed for under pier structure</p></li>
            <li><h4>Description: </h4><p>A rare find at the Santa Barbara pier. I used a technique not many do by having no weight except for the weight of the squid and tossed it near some support beams. The cabezon was suctioned onto the pole and darted towards my slowly falling squid. A fishing Youtuber I watch catches these all the time in Northern CA, but I was not expecting one at the pier. Most local fishermen didn't even know what it was.</p></li>
