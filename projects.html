                    Our mission is to eliminate the time wasted organizing group travel as well as the uncertainty of how much a driver should be compensated. The story below will demonstrate exactly how we accomplish this task.

                    After you log-in or sign-up, you are met <br>
                    with the option to <em>create</em>, <em>join</em> or <em>view</em> a trip.<br>
                    We will start off by creating one.

                    <em>code</em>. This code is how other users will be able<br>

                    To finalize the trip details, the creator of the trip is<br>
                    prompted to enter a <em>gas price</em>. This decesion was<br>
                    made after long consideration from our team, and we came <br>
                    to the conclusion that creators will determine the cost.<br>
                    To ensure full transparency, passengers of the trip are <br>
                    made aware of this ability and what the cost is.
