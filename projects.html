            Welcome to Fleet!
            After you log-in or sign-up, you are met 
            with the option to <em>create</em>, <em>join</em> or <em>view</em> a trip.
            We will start off by creating one.
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            Once you are navigated to the create screen
            there is a prompt to enter a <em>trip name</em> and unique
            <em>code</em>. This code is how other users will be able
            to join your trip.
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            Next, enter your <em>starting location</em> and
            <em>end location</em>. One feature we implemented was
            auto-complete for the most relevant location typed in.
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            To finalize the trip details, the creator of the trip is
            prompted to enter a <em>gas price</em>. This decesion was
            made after long consideration from our team, and we came 
            to the conclusion that creators will determine the cost.
            To ensure full transparency, passengers of the trip are 
            made aware of this ability and what the cost is.
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            When you would like to join a trip as a <em>driver</em>,
            on the home screen you can select <em>Join</em> where
            you will be prompted to enter the <em>trip code</em> and check
            that you are a driver.           
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            Next, select a <em>vehicle</em> from a list associated to your
            account. When you add a vehicle to your account the details
            needed are a <em>vehicle name</em>, <em>MPG</em> and <em>passenger seats</em>
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            While in a trip, you can view the <em>trip details</em> and
            all the <em>passengers</em> in your vehicle. You also have
            the ability to end a trip which will notify all passengers
            how much they owe given the <em>distance traveled</em>, 
            <em>gas price</em> and <em>MPG</em>.
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            Alternatively, if you were to join a trip as a passenger
            you would enter the <em>trip code</em> and simply leave the
            driver box unchecked then press <em>Join trip</em>
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            When you join a trip as a passenger you are navigated to
            a <em>trip information</em> screen. On this screen you can
            view the <em>start</em> and <em>end location</em> as well as <em>gas price</em>.
            Also the <em>trip code</em> is displayed at the top so you can copy
            and share with friends!
            At the bottom you will press <em>Vehicles</em> to choose who you're riding with.
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            After navigating to this screen, you can either view
            all the passengers in the group or <em>select a vehicle</em>.
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            After navigating to this screen, you can either view
            all the passengers in the group or <em>select a vehicle</em>.
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            Similar to the driver's active trip screen, you
            will be able to view the <em>trip details</em> and
            all the <em>passengers</em> in your vehicle. The only
            difference is that you are not able to end the trip.
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            After selecting <em>Trips</em> on the homescreen you
            will see a list of all the trips you have been on.
            Along with some details associated with each.
        </div>
        <div class = "description">
            The information saved in your history is the
            <em>start</em> and <em>end location</em> and <em>gas price</em>.
